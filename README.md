# Code Refractor Assignment

## The Keith Kompany for Horiseon Social Solution Services

**Premise** The Keith Kompany had partnered with Horiseon Social Solution Services to make their webpage more accessible to other developers. The objective was to have the source code formatted in a way to be more descriptive so that developers of all abilities could navigate & understand the code easily. 

The process of achieving this goal involved:

* Using semantic HTML elements

* Logical sequence in both HTML & CSS files

* Including clear alt attributes for images

* Descriptive Comments in the CSS file

* Simple & Organized CSS selectors

* A Relevant Title

* Maintaining the same layout when deployed

All adjustments made are accompanied by descriptive commit messages to outline exactly the reason for why such changes were made & how.

**Here is a screenshot of how it looks when deployed:**
